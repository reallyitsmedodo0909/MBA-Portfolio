My role was to collect data and insights from 25 existing clients of Evam Tech Labs by talking to their managers, stakeholders, and HR executives. As their vendor, I was fortunate to analyse their HR Data too. I concluded that every client will have different standards for KPI and KRA, so we should open the window for customization. As a Customer representative, I convinced new clients to adopt our KPI and KRA standards.
